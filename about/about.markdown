## Hello, I'm Chun Yuan. 
From quantity surveying to facilities management and then business analysis/IT project management, my career journey has been a thrilling ride. Now, I’m intrigued by the world of technology. With CS50P as my python foundation, I’m diving into data science with NumPy, pandas, and sklearn, uncovering new possibilities with each line of code.

Beyond coding, you'll find me enjoying coffee, hiking, or lost in a good book. Though my path has been unexpected, I've discovered a passion for tech. Here’s to embracing learning, overcoming challenges, and unlocking endless opportunities!

Connect with me , we can grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your jam):
