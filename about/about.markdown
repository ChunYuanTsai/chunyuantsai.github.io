## Hello, I'm Chun Yuan. 
From crunching numbers as a quantity surveyor to keeping facilities running smoothly as a facilities management associate, and then diving into the dynamic world of IT project management as a business analyst, my career journey has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. But now, I've found myself drawn to the captivating world of technology, and let me tell you, it's been quite the adventure!

With the foundations laid through CS50P, I'm currently exploring the realms of data science, tinkering with NumPy, pandas, and sklearn. It's a thrilling ride, filled with moments of triumph and, let's be honest, a fair share of head-scratching too. Exploring code is like embarking on a journey of discovery, where each line unveils new possibilities, and every breakthrough brings a surge of excitement.

When I'm not decoding the mysteries of code, you'll catch me sipping coffee, hiking in the mountains, or getting lost in a good book.

So, while my path may have taken unexpected turns, I've discovered a newfound passion in the world of tech. Here's to embracing the thrill of learning, tackling challenges, and unlocking the endless possibilities that technology has to offer!

Connect with me , we can grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your jam):
